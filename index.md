Welcome! I am Ethan (Ruize Hui), currently pursuing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS). My academic journey is driven by a passion for advancing the frontiers of machine learning and natural language processing.

My research focuses on developing **efficient and controllable AI systems**, with particular emphasis on:
- **Efficient AI**: Optimizing model architectures and training paradigms to reduce computational costs while maintaining performance
- **LLM Controllable Generation**: Advancing techniques for fine-grained control over large language model outputs to ensure reliability, safety, and alignment with user intent

I am always open to engaging discussions, collaborative research opportunities, and innovative projects that push the boundaries of AI technology. Feel free to reach out if you share similar research interests or have potential collaboration ideas.
